# Welcome to Python Ideas!

Would you like to help change something in Python? Then this might be the category for you! This category is for well-thought-out proposals and discussions. If your idea is not yet fully fleshed out, you might want to start in #users to get some initial feedback.

All ideas integrated into Python are developed, implemented and maintained by volunteers. This typically happens via the procedure outlined in [PEP 1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001). When you make a proposal, you volunteer to help make it happen. How you help depends on your skills and experience, but you should at least expect people to assume that you'll do research, lead the discussion and respond to comments and criticism. Don't expect others to do tasks that you don't want to do. See [Our Community](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/#our-community) in the Code of Conduct for more information.

## How to make a good Python Ideas post

1. First, consider Python's [Backwards Compatibility Policy](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387) and its implications for your idea.
2. Investigate also whether your idea, or a similar one, has been proposed before. If so, explain why it should move forward now if it didn't in the past. To find previous proposals, check at least the following:
    - The [PEP Index](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000)
    - The #ideas and #users categories on this forum
    - The historical [python-ideas](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-ideas@python.org) mailing list
    - The [issue tracker](https://github.com/python/cpython/labels/type-feature)
3. Address other ways to achieve the same goals as your idea. For example, why can't a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org), recipe in the documentation or utility function suffice to satisfy your idea? Explain why it is better that this be available in a few years when the version of Python with the feature is available than what can be offered now.
4. Give clear examples of how your idea would be used and what problems it would solve. Provide an in-depth overview of code bases where a real benefit can be shown.
5. Answer the following questions:
    - Who will develop and who will *maintain* the code and documentation for this idea?
    - How burdensome will these jobs be for whoever is doing them?
    - How will you personally contribute to the realization of this idea?
