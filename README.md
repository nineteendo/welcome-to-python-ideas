# Welcome to Python Ideas!

Would you like to change something in Python? Then this might be the category for you! Use it to get feedback on an idea you want to help add to a future version of Python. This category is for well-thought-out proposals and discussions. If your idea is not yet fully fleshed out, you might want to start in #users to get some initial feedback.

All ideas integrated into Python are developed, implemented and maintained by volunteers. This typically happens via the procedure outlined in [PEP 1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001). When you make a proposal, you volunteer to help make it happen. How you help depends on your skills and experience, but you should at least expect people to assume that you'll do research, lead the discussion and respond to comments and criticism. Don't expect others to do tasks that you don't want to do. See [Our Community](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/#our-community) in the Code of Conduct for more information.

## How to make a good Python Ideas post

1. First, consider Python's [Backwards Compatibility Policy](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387) and its implications for your idea.
2. You should also investigate whether your idea, or a similar one, has been proposed before. If so, your new proposal should address the reasons why the old one didn't move forward. Why should the idea move forward now if it didn't in the past? To find old similar proposals, check at least the following:
    - The [PEP Index](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000)
    - The #ideas and #users categories on this forum
    - The historical [python-ideas](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-ideas@python.org) mailing list
    - The [issue tracker](https://github.com/python/cpython/labels/type-feature)
3. Address other ways to achieve the same goals as your idea. Why are they not sufficient so that you are asking for a change to Python? For example, why can't a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org), recipe in the documentation or utility function suffice to satisfy your idea? You should also explain why it is better for this to be available in a few years, when the version of Python it is being added to is available, rather than right now, which is what a recipe or PyPI library offers.
4. Give clear examples of how your idea would be used and what problems it would solve. A simple GitHub search isn't good enough, you need to provide an in-depth review of codebases where a real benefit can be demonstrated.
5. Answer the following questions:
    - Who will develop and who will *maintain* the source code and documentation for this idea?
    - How burdensome will these jobs be for whoever is doing them?
    - How will you personally contribute to the realization of this idea?
