# Welcome to Python Ideas!

Would you like to help change something in Python? Then this might be the category for you! If your idea is not yet fully fleshed out, you might want to start in #users to get some initial feedback.

All ideas integrated into Python are developed, implemented and maintained by volunteers. How you help depends on your skills and experience, but you should at least expect people to assume that you'll do research, lead the discussion and respond to comments and criticism. Don't expect others to do tasks that you don't want to do. See [Our Community](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/#our-community) in the Code of Conduct for more information.

## How to make a good Python Ideas post

1. First, consider Python's [Backwards Compatibility Policy](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387) and its implications for your idea.
2. Investigate also whether your idea, or a similar one, has been proposed before. If so, explain why it should move forward now if it didn't in the past. To find previous proposals, check at least the following:
    - The [PEP Index](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000)
    - The #ideas and #users categories on this forum
    - The historical [python-ideas](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-ideas@python.org) mailing list
    - The [issue tracker](https://github.com/python/cpython/labels/type-feature)
3. Address other ways to achieve the same goals as your idea. For example, why can't a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org), recipe in the documentation or utility function suffice to satisfy your idea? Explain why it is better that this be available in a few years when the version of Python with the feature is available than what can be offered now.
4. Give clear examples of how your idea would be used and what problems it would solve. Provide an in-depth overview of code bases where a real benefit can be shown.
5. Answer the following questions:
    - Who will develop and who will *maintain* the code and documentation for this idea?
    - How burdensome will these jobs be for whoever is doing them?
    - How will you personally contribute to the realization of this idea?

## Guidelines

As the author of an idea topic:

- Stick with one idea for a long time. Ideas can take years to formulate and implement. Propose one thing you care about and stick with it.
- Proposing a ton of ideas simultaneously, or immediately proposing something else after a previous idea is rejected, quickly becomes disruptive.
- Jumping around between completely different areas of focus makes it difficult to understand if you have a deep understanding in any one topic. Conversely, repeatedly making slightly different ideas about the same thing if previous ones are declined, makes it difficult to understand if you're actually receptive to feedback.
- Don't take negative reactions to an idea personally. You care about your idea, but you need to be prepared for others to have different views. Continuously posting defenses of your idea, rather than responding to feedback and evolving (or dropping) the idea, quickly becomes uninteresting for others to participate.
- Make sure you're actually getting positive reactions from the people who will actually implement/maintain what you're proposing.
- You will be more successful if the community and maintainers are familiar with you. Participating constructively with the existing backlog of ideas and issues gains you experience and trust. Reducing the existing workload gives maintainers more time to actually engage with and consider new requests. This requires long term dedication, it is not something that happens in a month.

As a participant (including the author) in an idea topic:

- Do not respond to every post as soon as you see it. Wait for others to participate, digest what they say, then post perhaps once or twice a day.
- Do not respond to every post. Decide what avenues to focus on and what are distractions. Otherwise responses become huge essays without a clear thesis, difficult to follow, and difficult for others to digest and respond to themselves.
- If you disagree with something, you do not have to post. You do not need to have the last word. Not responding, and letting a discussion naturally conclude, is often the better decision.
- Step away if you find yourself arguing in any way. Flag posts for moderators to step in.
